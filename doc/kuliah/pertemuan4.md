Background
As we learn together in geographic information systems, there is a spatial data that is useful to an observation by looking at the location. The spatial data identifying the features and also the location of the position above the Earth's surface. Spatial data is also often referred to as geospatial data with the data of the geographical information can be captured in GIS.
Retrive Data Geospatial data capture is the way geometry and geospatial data, database data is a data vector which is one type of geospatial data because the data vector data in the form of a shape, so that data can be used to retrive diphyton, in it there is a SHP data storing the data geometry didalamanya, namely:
1. bBox: coordinates display limit is dipeta, sometimes rectangular dipeta, bbox is a boundary box i.e. the coordinates of the point 4
2. Shape Type:
-Coordinate Point: point (1 point/coordinates) bernomer standard 1 from ESRI
-PolyLine: Coordinates which form the line but do not form a standard 3 bernomer area from ESRI
-Polygon: Coordinates form a standard 5 bernomer area from ESRI
Discussion and content:
1. Operation of data capture with Python

Read the number of Geometry data:
> > import shapefile
> > sf records ()
> > sf records (n)

Read the number of Geometry data:
> > import shapefile
> > sf = shapefile. Reader ("URnamafile.shp")
> > sf. shapes ()
> > a = sf. shapes ()
> > len (a)

SUGGESTIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
The use of the class of the method method in manipulating retrive data capture is the way geometry and a Database of geospatial data where such data is a data vector which is one type of geospatial data in geographic information
As a suggestion it is best to be in the development of SIG is with a lot of review and learn a lot of material about geographic information systems
