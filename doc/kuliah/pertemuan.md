Before getting to know more about Geospatial Data certainly should know in depth about the reference map coordinates system globally. The existence of a fundamental understanding of spatial geospatial or be called by the name of the terrestrial space that all of its spatial aspects of a layout, the location and also the position where an object is located in a region of the Earth's surface so that it can be expressed in a system of coordinates.
Geospatial data that we know is data relating to the geographical location, size dimensions or characteristics of objects of natural or artificial Division travelled may under or above the surface. Geospatial data that have been collected or processed may be collected as a tool in policy formulation, decision making and implementation of activities related to the terrestrial space, in this case Geospatial Information through recorded
As we know Geospatial Information can be distinguished into 2 IE
Geospatial information can be differenciated into two:
1. Basic Geospatial Information is a representation of geospatial information about the object can be seen directly, or physical appearance is measured from the ground and which do not change in time is relatively long.
2. Thematic Geospatial Information is a geospatial information serves one or more specific themes (related to the element of Earth) made with reference to the basic geospatial information.

Conclusions and Suggestions
With the geospatial data we are able to know the various layout, location, including on the size or characteristics of objects whether it is man-made or who have been there. Through the application of Geospatial data the Information above will be used as a tool for the implementation of dam management or data searches associated with the terrestrial room
After learning various information or concept about geospatial data we can find more references as ancillary or supporting learning activities that are more about SIGS primarily in terms of the concept of GEOSPATIAL DATA itself.
