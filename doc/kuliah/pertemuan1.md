The Definition Of The GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)

Geographic information systems (GIS) is a combination of three principal elements, namely, systems, information, and geographically. Be aware that SIG is a system that places emphasis on the element of geographical information. Geographic information contains the notion of information about places that are on the surface of the Earth, knowledge of the layout of an object at the Earth's surface, and information about information (attributes) that is present in the Earth's surface that its position is known.

Projection System Map

A map is a representation of konvemsional (miniature) of those elements (features) physical (natural and man-made) from sabgian or even the entire Earth's surface above the plane of the flat media with a certain scale. To describe the features that we need a system which describes the State of the Earth is actually called projection. The purpose of the projection map is to move patterns or elements that are present above a surface to another surface by using a mathematical formula so that retrieved the desired condition. the projection used in SIG i.e. projection Longitude Latitude (Longlat) and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)


a. Latitude and Longitude projection system

This projection is commonly used to describe the State of the global. The unit used is the degree units (degrees or 0). The units of this degree is represented by a unit of decimal degree, DMS (degree minute second) and DM Degree minute decimals). For example: 15.15 0 means 15.15 degree (degree) 1503012511 means 15 degrees (degree) 30 minutes and 25 seconds. The symbolism is used in unit DMS 30.51 150 means 15 degrees (degree) 30.5 minutes. The projection is based on longlat from the Earth's spheroid shape, divided over the upright line slicing the Earth from the northern hemisphere to South Pole called meridian lines and horizontal lines that divide the Earth from East to West are called parallel lines. The line passes through the city of meridian Grenwich 00, United Kingdom, the implication is the presence of different time divisions on areas in all parts of the East and West.



Change the value of the line going vertically merdian along a horizontal line which we refer to as longitude or point x. Whereas paralell line turned horizontally along the vertical line and we called as Latitude or point y. aftermath of the existence of parallel lines is the difference of the seasons in the southern and Northern regions of the Earth.

This coordinate Sisitem embraced the Division of the world into four fields, namely

Longitude East (0-90o) often abbreviated with BT or East (E)
West longitude (0-90o) often abbreviated with W or WEST (W)
North latitude (0-45 o) is often abbreviated with the N or North (N)
South latitude (0-45 o) is often abbreviated with LS or South (S)

In General Indonesia refers to name the eastern Longitude and West longitude to western, while the northern hemisphere or Northern is referred to as North latitude and vice versa the southern hemisphere or Southern referred to as South latitude. The following is an example of the application of the longlat projection for the countries around the world.

HE IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF GIS
Geographic information systems can be utilized to ease in getting data that have been processed and Stored as an attribute of a location or object. Data that is processed in the SIG is basically composed of spatial data and attribute data in digital form. This system merelasikan of spatial data (geographic location) and non-spatial data, so that its users can create maps and analyze the information in various ways. GIS is a powerful tool for handling spatial GIS data, which in maintained in digital form so that data is more solid than in the form of a printed map, table, or other conventional in form which will eventually speed up work and relieve the cost required.


There are several reasons why underlying the need to use the SIG, according to Anon (2003, in U.s. Syakur 2007) the underlying reasons are:

1. using GIS spatial data or attribute in terintergarsi.
2. GIS can separate between the presentation and data base.
3. the SIG has the ability to elaborate on the elements of the existing elements of the Earth's surface into multiple layers or spatial coverage.
4. The SIG has a very good ability in describing spatial data following its attributes.
5. All operations SIG can be done interactively.
6. SIG easily generate thematic maps.
7. GIS is helpful job that closely kaitanya with spatial and geoinformatika fields
