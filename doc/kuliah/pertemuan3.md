The concept of the use of Natural Earth Data in GIS Applications using QGIS

Background
In the use of data access terhdap the concept of GIS to find a layout in a geographic information system, because in the vast Earth requires a lot of data to access it. Therefore, the required presentation of data through GIS software for the processing of the application or usage. without software to find the location where the data is very wide in various parts of the world will be a much needed research so long or may direct that the review will be conducted will be spent much of the time.
With the application that is free for download by anyone including those students who want to know many things about the geographical location that exists in the world.
Explanations and solutions to problems
One of the applications that are very supportive of users of geographic information systems is a QGIS, the application can be obtained via the official website qgis.org. QGIS site serves the application open source or free for istila IT. In addition we can also get a form of provision of data around the world that are capable of being processed by the application of QGIS. Through the site naturalearth.com you can download the data, in the Natural Earth itself there are many data from different sides of the world, one of which provides the physical data, vector as well as cultural.

Conclusions and solutions
To view the contents of various parts of the world, of which there are very necessary tools like GIS software that will be used to perform the data processing of the natural earth like the explanation above. It's just that it takes a greater understanding to support the achievement of the presentation of the data and do a research the data that will appear in the application of QGIS.
For an application in the development of a suggestion aimed at SIG will be increasingly more in order to enhance learning and understanding and SIG.
